                        Just a moment, we're detecting if Citrix Workspace app is already installed.
                        If Citrix Workspace app is detected, you will see a window in a few seconds. Please choose Launch Application.
                        If app is not detected, no window appears. Then click Download.
                        Note: Clicking Already installed allows you to bypass running the client detection. However, you lose features like domain pass-through authentication, which requires the native Workspace app detection to complete successfully.
